<h2><b>Questions, comments and answers.</a></b></h2>


<p>23 October 2005<br> <b>Lecture Notes</b> I'm wondering whether or
not you have a master set of notes from your few years teaching this
course that you could put up on the web for when we miss the odd
lecture (due to circumstances beyond our control obviously).  Also,I
read the Q & A from last year and was wondering if youve always worn
black?  Sound<br> <b>Reply</b> I don't really have a master set, my
notes are quite sketchy and illegible since I don't use them to
lecture, I try and teach by doing examples and I think it is better if
I do the examples live as were. I hope that the material on the
website will be help, it tells you what was in the lecture; there are
notes on hard bits and book reference, the problems sheets have useful
equations and so on printed on them. Normally though, people who miss
lectures copy the notes from the classmates and if they are still
confused they can email me and ask me to add more notes to the notes
page, that's kind of how I build it up, I add stuff in response to
requests. As for the other thing, I grew up in Galway and was there in
the late 80s when wearing all black was a fashion: it got to be a
habit.</p>
<p>3 November 2005<br> <b>Problem Set 3</b> Hi, Its not avail on the website. 
<br> <b>Reply</b> I usually put them up the Sunday following the tutorial, but I 'll put this one up in a minute.</p>

<p>3 November 2005<br> <b>Tutorials</b> I was wondering if you could
post the problem sheets on the web before the tutorials so that we can
make better use of the demonstrator and be more likely to get the
sheets finished. Thank you.  <br> <b>Reply</b> I have tried this
before and decided it didn't work as well, it seemed to affect the way
the tutorial worked in a way that made them less usefull. The
important thing isn't finishing them but having a go and trying to get
help when you are stuck.</p>

<p>8 November 2005<br> <b>prob sheet 2 solns</b> cant get the solutions on the web for the second prob sheet. page won't open up. can you remedy this problem?<br> <b>Reply</b> Sorry about that, it should be fixed now.</p>

<p>8 November 2005<br> <b>so far</b> i just wish all the lectures were like yourself!Clear, able to control the class (you would swear we were 11 not 21), and good online help. I would email to complain so why not 2 say something nice for a change!
 <br> <b>Reply</b> Thanks a million for your kind comments. I am also pretty happy with how things are going. If you do have complaints, please email them, I can take it and its better I know if there is a problem.</p>   

<p>14 November 2005<br> <b>Tutorial Sheets on Web</b> 
Hi Mr. Houghton, I'm wondering if you could put each weeks tutorial sheet on your website before the tutorial on Wednesday, so we can take a look at it before the tutorial, so that we'll be able to make the most of the hour!
Thanks<br>
<b>Reply</b> As mentioned above, I did try this for a while and actually feel that the tutorials go better the way they are now, with the sheet unseen prior to the tutorial. The best way to get the most out of the hour is to go over the solutions afterwards when they are posted on the web. </p>


<p>7 December 2005<br> <b>Paternity testing and Colanders</b> 
Completely off-topic comment but thanks for creating such an interesting website. That picture of you wearing a colander with your son is hilarious. Astronomy picture of the day is pretty cool as well though focail an lae seems to be a broken link. Slightly unorthodox webpage for your father (Is it meant to be ironic in some way?) In any case, keep up with the good lectures. They're the only ones I actually look forward to.<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for this, I haven't updated these links in ages so I am kind of embarrassed you looked at them, as for the father link, that is actually what my father does, he runs a paternity testing service. I am glad it is the collander picture you found funny and not the pictures on the rocket pages of me with long hair. Glad you enjoy the lectures.</p>

<p>9 December 2005<br> <b>Sick engineers: agar drink</b> Thanks for
the compulsory bulimia I received after drinking the agar jelly
drink. At lunch, being that it is the last day of term, 6 of us
decided to go to the pav for a drink. After a pint we decided to get
the lad who won the cans to open one of them. After all of us had a
bit two of us said we'd see what it was like with vodka, trying to set
a new trend. this ended in disaster. while pouring it we noticed there
was lumps in it but split the rest of the can into our glasses.  After
drinking half of it, we put down our glasses, unable to finish it. I
then puked into the glass, filling it to the brim. I then got off the
bench(we were outside thankfully) and puked up my lunch in the
corner. Now, the 2 of us are feeling rotten. I'll send you the
hospital bill after christmas. Has a stomach transplant ever been done
before?<br> <b>Reply</b> I hope you didn't really suffer so badly; the
east asian drinks are bought at a supermarket and shouldn't cause
problems like that, in fact, they are usually among the most popular
prizes although the lumps are unnerving.</p>


<p>21 December 2005<br> <b>Convolution</b> Hi, I was just going over
the convolution theorem..I was reading your example in the notes on
your webpage - Note 7: The convolution cost*cost - and I can get as
far as (6) but I'm then stuck Maybe I've forgotten some basic
integration stuff :\ but I can't work out how you got the integral of
1/2 (cost dtau) from t to 0, to equal 1/2 tcost. I can see where the rest comes from but I just don't get how you integrated with respect to tau when there is no tau in that particular integral. Do you treat the t as a constant? Sorry to bother you, thanks for your time!
<br> <b>Reply</b> There is no tau in the cos t so it comes out infront:<br> 
int_0^t cost dtau =cos t int_0^t dt=t cos t <br>
the integral is just the integral of one and integrating one from zero to t dtau gives tau]_0^t where _ means subscript and ^ means superscript. As far as a tau integration is concerned t is just like a constant,<br>
Hope this helps, email again if not, happy christmas,</p>

<p>10 January 2006<br> <b>Christmas</b> Get anything good for Christmas? 
<br> <b>Reply</b> Yes.</p>

<p>16 January 2006<br> <b>Schols</b> I was just looking at the past
papers and it seems we have less choice for your part of the
course. Will that be repeated this year? Is there any particular
reason for this? Also do you know if a 2.1 exempts you from both math
exams at the end of the year?<br> 
<b>Reply</b> My part of the schol paper will
have the same format as previous years and, yes, this means you have
less of a choice in my section, I feel that three out of four is about
right for this sort of exam. As far as I know an overall 2.1 exempts
you from all summer exams.</p>

<p>16 January 2006<br> <b>Schols (again!)</b> Question 9 is very
similar in 2002 and 2005, is this a common occurance in your exam
papers? Also there doesn't seem to be much content used from last year
such as matrices, only in section A. Does this mean section B will
only be questions from your course?  
<br><b>Reply</b> 
I think it is good to
sometimes reuse exam questions, reusing the odd question, or using a
schol question in the annual exam, with more hints, encourages
students to go through and do lots and lots of past papers questions
which I is very good practise for the course, in other words, in
trying to prepare for a repeated question people get good at all the
questions, so, yes, I have decided to make it policy to repeat
questions from time to time, but I don't promise to do it every
time. I base my questions on the course I teach and hence not
explicitely on last year. Since my course follow on very directly from
the first year courses, I feel that knowing how to answer my questions
shows that you have understood first year.</p>

<p>31 January 2006<br> <b>Johnny Cash</b> Just wondering are you a big
Johnny Cash fan, hence the fact you only ever wear
black?<br><b>Reply</b> I guess I quite like Johnny Cash, the last album
particularily, but, no that isn't why I wear black, that's more just a
habit and because I think it looks cool.</p>

<p>31 January 2006<br> <b>Tutorial 11 solution</b> Could you please put the solution to tutorial 11 on your web page.
Thanks.
<br><b>Reply</b> Done</p>

<p>12 February 2006<br> <b>Tutorial</b> Any chance of you putting up
the tutorial sheet for this week on the net, seeing that it will be a
long one?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Although I know some people disagree, there really is general support for only giving out the sheets on the day. Please, don't think you'll be able to get every question out at every tutorial class, the important thing is to have a go and learn a few key aspects of doing the questions.</p>

<b>Oasis or Blur?</b>
Just wondering if you had to pick one, which one would it be...Oasis or Blur?<br>
<b>Reply</b> I was never a big britpop fan, but probably Oasis.</p>

<p>5 March 2006<br>
<b>Donal O'Donovan</b>
We had Dr.O'Donovan last year...he's not a bad lecturer, but he tends to make up his problem sheets up as he goes along, and doesn't put any notes/solutions up on the net. Can you ensure that when he takes over from you that tutorials will run in the same manner as they do now, and that solutions will be put up on the net as they are now after each tutorial?<br>
Best of luck in the States.<br>
<b>Reply</b> I'll pass your message on to him, but I expect he has thought about his approach here and decided that what he does is the best thing to do within the format of his class.</p>

<p>23 April 2006<br>
<b>Q4 2005</b>
Could you please put up the solution to last years annual exam Q4 if you get a chance? Itd be much appreciated. Thanks a million!!
<br>
<b>Reply</b> No problem, should be there now.</p>

<p>14 May 2006<br>
<b>PS 18</b>
Not sure if your still checking out this comment page but if you are
any chance of problem sheet 18 solution being put up? Thanks<br>
<b>Reply</b> I wasn't intending to do this since it was Donal who gave
it out I wanted to respect his system, whatever it is. However, if you
want to ask about one of the questions, I would be happy to give an
answer to it here.</p>

<b>Heat Flow Equation</b> Could you put up the solution to 2005,
question 9 please. Ive been trying to do it by following the Heat Flow
tutorial you have on last years page but Im not getting
anywhere. Thanks.<br>
<b>Reply</b> So last years Tutorial was:<br>

ps</a>. Sample question on the heat equation, not given in a
tutorial.<br>
where I go through a heat equation example very like the one on the
exam. It is possible Donal did it a different way,
or that he covered a different problem or different material instead, if what I have confuses you, it
might be best to ask Donal directly about what he did, but, I have
gone through the tutorial sheet and added some more, perhaps waffly, details and also
made closer to what was on the exam:<br>

<b>Exam</b> Hey, you have any last minute tips for the exam tomorrow
;) ? Thanks.<br>
<b> REply</b> Well I hope it went well!</p>

<p>24 May 2006<br> <b>exam :(</b> Just got back from your
exam. Question 1 was wrecked because you left out the Laplace
transform for d(t-a) on your table, the relevant transform was handed
out after I had made an attempt at this question more than half an
hour into the exam. Had to go back and try to fix it which took extra
time. The Z-transform part 2 was too difficult, didn't really know
what to do with u, I just noticed that a similar question was on a
schol exam. This is meant to be a summer exam..not schol type
questions... not to mention that crazy Laplace proof for the integral
for question 2. I'm sure you disagree and think your exam was very
fair and easy, but anyway, this form says feedback so that's just my
opinion.<br> <b>Reply</b> I am very sorry about the mistake with the
tables, that is a mess and we will make an effort to make allowances
for this in the marking scheme. As for the rest of it, some questions
are harder than others and, while some of the exam was predictable
and, as with every year, one or two questions were unusual. These,
harder, questions will be marked in a very easy going way. I did talk
a lot about looking back at the schol paper, I said it in three
different lectures and it isn't the first time I gave a schol question
again in the exam. I hope you have done well despite disliking the
paper. I do think the paper was fair and of a suitable standard for
the course, which isn't the same as easy. <br> <b>Reply to my
reply</b> Thanks for your quick reply. Sorry, I was being unreasonable
about it being unfair, put it down to exam stress. Should have checked
out those schol papers before the exam. Ah well. Thanks again. Have a
nice summer.<br> <b>Reply to that</b> No need to apologise, the whole
point of the feedback page is for you to able to write whatever you
want, it works for me because I get the last word. I hope 2E2 turns
out to have gone ok and good luck with the rest of your exams.</p>

<p>24 May 2006<br> <b>exam</b> hey, just wanted to say thatnks for
being great lecturer over the year. I always liked your lectures,
which is not at all bad considering they were at 9am on a Friday
morning! I thought the exam was a bit tough, (think i messed up Q3)
but not unfair. Anyway, best of luck in the future. Itll be next years
second years loss if they dont have you. Thanks again!!<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for your kind remarks, I will miss teaching 2E2
and I certainly missed finishing the year your class. Question 3 was
certainly hard, but it will be marked accordingly. All the best for
the rest of your exams.</p>

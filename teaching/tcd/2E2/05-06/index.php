<p>This lecture course will mostly deal with differential
equations. It is lectured by me, Conor Houghton. It is similar to the
course of the same name I taught last year.</p>

<p>My email address is houghton@maths.tcd.ie and my office is at the
top of the maths department, half way between the discussion room and
Donal O'Donavan's office. If you want to contact me anonymously, for
example to complain about the course, you can use the feedback
facility linked from the sidebar. I also intend to give a one line
description of each lecture as I go along; again, this is linked from
the side bar.</p>

<p>You can still look at <a
href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~houghton/TEACHING/2E2/2E2-04-05/2E2.php">last
year's 2E2 website</a>.  The problem sheets will be quite similar to
this years, not identical. If you want to look at last years
solutions, that's fine, but don't bring them into the tutorial with
you. There is an <a
href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/official/Courses01-02/2E2.html">
Official 2E2 page.</a> Dmitri Zaitsev teaches 2E1 and also has a <a
href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~zaitsev/2E1.html">course website</a>.
</p>

<p>The weekly tutorials make up 10% of the final mark and the summer exam the remaining 90%.</p>

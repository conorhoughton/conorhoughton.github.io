Oct 2003<br> <b>Error in the solns.</b> You might want to look at question 2 in the solutions sheet,I think its
incorrect!!!! It should be t squared instead of t to the 5?
<br> <b>Reply</b> You are right, thanks, I have corrected it now.

Nov 2003<br> <b>Why do you wear black?</b> Hey.just wondering why do you wear black all the time, does it give you
super-maths-powers or something?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Yes, something like that.

Nov 2003<br> <b>Notes?</b> Are the notes that you put on the web from a book? And if so,which one?<br>
<b>Reply</b> No, they are notes I have written myself over the time I
have been teaching the course, sometimes when I do something and
people don't seem to understand it so well I add a note and sometimes
when I change the problem sheets I put the old problem up as a note,
that happened two weeks ago with the periodic Laplce question. I wrote
out the Z-transform notes last year because people complained that
they had trouble getting this book James mentioned in the book list. The course is based on James and the notes are based on the course, so I guess the notes kind of come from James.

28 Nov 2003<br><b>Downloading solutions</b> 
When i try to access the solutions for problem 7 im getting this type
of crap:The document name you requested
(/~houghton/TEACHING/2E2/PS-03-04/soln7.pdf) could not be found on
this server.  However, we found documents with names similar to the
one you requested(ya solutions 1-6 which i have!!).
<br><b>Reply</b> Sorry, my fault. It should be working now. On a similar issue, one person says they had trouble downloading the Z-transform notes, but I can't find any problem with them. If anyone else has had trouble with these, let me know!<p>
3 Dec 2003<br> <b>Carlow Colours</b> Question 1 on Christmas quiz 2001 your answer isn't totally right. Your missing the third Carlow colour of gold (or yellow) depending on who you ask but still your wrong. <br>
<b>Reply</b> That sounds very colourful, it's a pity we don't see them more often in Croke Park. Anyway, sorry, I've corrected the answers.<p>
5 Jan 2004<br> <b>Tutorials starting?</b> Any 2E2 tutorials this week?<br>
<b>Reply</b> There is yeah.<p>
21 Jan 2004<br> <b>Prob 10</b> Why are the solutions to problem sheet 10,solutions to Laplace
transforms and not phase diagrams!!??<br>
<b>Reply</b> That would be a mistake, sorry. I have fixed it now.<p>
25 Jan 2004<br><b>Extra classes for schols</b> I was curious as to whether it would be possible if by any chance extra classes or extra sheets on them could be given, with a view of people using them for studying for the schols (as well as with the given notes over the last year and a half). As you know, Engineering is a hugely time consuming degree, and since i am asking most of the lecturers we have this year, perhaps the notes may be a more viable option, if you agree.<p> Should you be otherwise engaged, and time is unavailable, if one set of notes would be made available i could upload them onto my website and then inform the class about the availability of them, or spend time photocopying them and then distribute them to the class myself. What do you think?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Precisely because Engineering is a very time consuming degree, I am
unwilling to give extra classes for schols, I base the schol exams on the
classes I have already given. I don't believe revision lectures are very
useful; I am always available to go through things with students in my
office, this is good because it is directed whatever particular points the
students may have trouble with.<p>
 As for notes, as you know I have extensive material on my website to help
students studying the course, this includes solutions to previous
scholarship papers. I amn't sure what material you feel I am missing, but,
if you point out anything you feel would be useful, I will try my best to
add it.<p>
 Anyway, I am always willing to help, but I am unwilling to do things which
in effect put more work on students. Let me know.<p>
26 Jan 2004<br> <b>Chinese new year</b> Cheers for letting us put a
bit early for Chinese New Year; it meant a lot to some of us... it's
always nice to see people appreciate other people^?s cultures... Can
you tell us where to purchase some of those delicious assortments of
Chinese fruit drinks???<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for this message, I was pleased to get it. I am a
bit embarrassed though that I only let you off four minutes early, I
had meant it to be ten minutes but the guy at the start talking about
the schols threw my timing off. The Asia Market on Drury street is the
place for Chinese fruit drinks.<p>
26 Jan 2004<br><b>4 Minutes</b> Wasn't it really 2 minutes, not 4 minutes earlier we got off for the
chinese new years? Why would you lie to us?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Only 2 minutes, now I am very embarrassed.<p>
26 Jan 2004<br><b>The REAL Conor Houghton</b> Just livening these comments up, how are you all today?<br>
<b>Reply</b> None really. <p>
27 Jan 2004<br><b>Dog racing</b> A few of my friends and I are planning a trip to the dogs on Thursday night after reading the short article on your website.But first we would like
to ask you a few questions..1) Are the dogs on on Thursday...2) How do you get
there....)Any progress with the research on the "equation which relates
information on the racing form cards to the probability of a dog winning"...and
last but not least......4) any chance yourself and your collegues in the maths
department could design an equation modelled on the equation below
    (very little money)=(many large winning bets)+(rivers of beer)^2(naked
women)^3+(no need to return to college)<br>
<b>Reply</b> My work on dog racing is on-going, my main research is on
solitons in three-d, but I am also interested in evolving neural nets
and dog-racing data is a good test case. I have made some progress and
hope to be able to beat the bookies before too long. I can't say I'll
let you know when I succeed, and, of course, the college owns the
intellectual property, but, if I turn up in a new suit and with a
liveried Jeeves figure to wipe the board for me and top up my coffee,
you'll know what's happened. I don't think it is my place to give
directions to shelbourne park, you basically walk south on pearse
street and its on your right, racing on wednesday, thursday and
saturday, www.shelbournepark.ie. remember, unless you have my secret
formula, you always loose in the end.<p>
28 Jan 2004<br><b>PS11 and schol past paper</b> In solutions sheet 11,is there suppose to be a phase diagram for
question 3? Also will you be putting the solutions to 2003 schols paper on your
website?<br>
<b>Reply</b> The question didn't ask for a phase diagram, in fact, that's the first question on PS12, todays problem sheet. I am sorry I haven't done last years schol yet, things have been a bit crazy for me for the last few weeks, but I am really hoping to get it done in the next couple of days.<p> 
28 Jan 2004<br><b>Continued from above</b>
Sorry never saw that you only ask to find the solution of Q3 in sheet
11,but what would the phase diagram look like anyway?<br>
<b>Reply</b> That'll be in next weeks solutions<p>
3 Feb 2004<br><b>q2 2003 schol</b> In 2003 schols solutions Q2(z-transforms),for the first part of the
question when you take the z transform of both sides i think there may be a
mistake,when i do it i manage to get a -zsquared-2z on the left handside where
as you only get a -z,obviously the other stuff is on the right and lefthand
sides as normal but its just i dont seem to get the -z like you do,maybe you
could check this out for me(i may be wrong!!).Thanks.<br>
<b>Reply</b> My solution to this question has a mistake, I have fixed
this now. Sorry about that and thanks a million for pointing it
out. Don't worry, these aren't the solutions I used when marking the
exam, they got losted so I did the questions again, incorrectly in
this case. As you see, the answer is quite suprising and I had at the
back of mind the idea that something suprising happened.<p> 4 Feb
2004<br><b>Comments on course</b> I would like to voice my opinion
that an Easter Quiz similar in structure to that of the Christmas quiz
would be of the great benefit to the class. i hope you agree with me
and i look forward to the event. Also on a sadder note, you haven't
told very many stories in a long time. to me these are what make your
lectures all the more memorable and hope i that you will tell some
more soon.<br>
<b>Reply</b> I am afraid there will be no Easter Quiz, where would it
end, every year more and more demands for more and more quizes until I
end up spending all my money on spud guns and exotic fruit drinks. I
am sorry there haven't been so many stories of late, my other class
felt that I told too many and so I have been holding back. <p> 5 Feb
2004<br><b>Great Site!</b> just wanna say, me being a student who has
done no work all year and is on MAJOR catch up in all areas of
engineering, your site is AMAZING!! having all the notes online like
that I think I could get a 1st in 2e2 if I study.... and your lectures
are the only ones I listen to aswell, i fall asleep/talk in every
other subject :/ yeah funny story today in your lecture about the piss
falling out of the roof in eastend room hehe ! your now up there with
O'Donavon from last year as my favourite lecturers :P <br><b>Reply</b>
Thanks for your kind remarks, although, I would feel better if you did
some work, it makes college a richer and more varied experience if you
study as well as all the other stuff. I have passed your remarks on to
Donal. If you have any suggestions as to how I could improve the site,
by the way, please let me know.
<p>
6 Feb 2004<br><b>Tutorial 6+7 Solutions</b> I think the formula for the Z Transform you have given in Qu. 3 in the
Tutorial 6 Sloutions is wrong. Should it be one over Z to the power of k
nought, rather than one over k nought?  Also in Qu. 2 Tutorial 7 Solutions,
half way through the question, after you have separated using partial
fractions, you forgot to multply the right hand side of the equation by Z. The
answer is still right though.<br>
<b>Reply</b> You are right both times, thanks a million for pointing this out to me, I have made the corresponding corrections.<p>
12 Feb 2004<br><b>Brithday</b> Happy Birthday Conor!O ya by the way in the notes section note 28 does
not seem to be readable for some reason, maybe its the program you were working
off!?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for the birthday wishes. Note 28 is a maple
worksheet, it is really just to show how this is done, but only makes
sense if it is used with the computer programme maple, maple is a symbolic maths package, you learn next year how to use Mathematica, which is very similar.<p>
16 Feb 2004<br><b>Note 28</b>
In the notes,notes 28,there is suppose to be a drawing or something.
Well when you try to open it you get a load of words and stuff!?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Sorry I didn't reply to the 12 Feb message sooner, it answers this question, basically I only put this up as a look-no-tricks explaination as to how the pictures in the solution sheets are done.<p>
18 Feb 2004<br><b>Schols Questions</b>
How will the questions on your section of the maths schols paper be split up?  For example will the first question be laplace transforms and the second maybe Z-transforms......<br><b>Reply</b> Same as the other years, one Laplace, one Z-transform, one equations and one series solutions. The equations question can be on tanks, or systems of linear equations or linearization.<p>

27 Feb 2004<br><b>Examples</b> 
I think this course is very well structured. More examples would be
nice but of course time is scarce.<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for your comments, I try to do as many examples as I can, but, as you say, there is only so much time.<p>


3 Mar 2004<br><b>Schols question 4 2003</b> 
Just wonder will you be putting the solution to question 4 on the
schols paper 2003 up on your website.<br>
<b>Reply</b> It is up now.<br>
<b>Reply 2</b> Actually, the first time I was answering an earlier draft of question 4, I actually changed it at the last minute to make the question slightly easier, I have put up a solution to the correct version now.<p>

5 Mar 2004<br><b>Stephen Hawking</b> I hear you tell a great story
about Stephen Hawking...this I cant wait to hear..when are we gonna
hear it?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Well, I don't always tell the same stories, I told the
Stephen Hawking story because I was trying to unplug one of the
speakers and almost fell and that was related to the story; if I come
close to hurting myself by falling while I'm lecturing you, I'll tell
the story again.<p>

10 Mar 2004<br><b>Hail to the Thief</b>
Sorry about the schol exam there... No disrespect was meant to your subject : )
You stole my average though, Whats the z transform of k anyway? (that rhymes)
<br>
<b>Reply</b> I am sorry you felt this way, you didn't actually do too
bad. See the 21 Apr reply for the z transform of k.<p>


25 Mar 2004<br><b>Past papers</b>
I just wanted to say that i website is excellent , i find all the
solutions to tutorials and papers very usefull, but is there any chance that
you could put up , more of the previous ,end of year exam solutions on your
website.<br>
<b>Reply</b> With the exception of last years autumn exam, which I
will do soon, I have put up answers for all the exams I set, this is
all I mean to do, because the course content changed around the time I
took it over and so the older exams aren't such a good guide.<p>

14 Apr 2004<br><b>Website</b>
I would just like to say thank you for the work that you put in
regarding the info on the site which you provide for us. It is very thorough
and easy to understand. If only all our courses were like that.<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for this, if you have any suggestions for the website let me know. The main thing I want to do is to add notes on Bessel functions and the Legendre equation, I will try to get that done this week.<p>

15 Apr 2004<br><b>Galway</b>
i didnt know you were from galway. thats pretty cool ( mainly cos im
from galway and im really cool!).<br>
<b>Reply</b> The world is full of cool people from Galway and Galway is full of cool people from the rest of the world, but the people from Galway in Galway aren't cool, why is that?<p>

21 Apr 2004<br><b>Z-transforms</b> Whats a k on its own in Z-transforms?
<br><b>Reply</b> Z(kr^(k-1))=z/(z-r)^2, this is in the table and can be worked out from Z(a^k)=z/(z-r) by differenciating with respect to r, now, put r=1 and you get Z(k)=z(z-1)^2.<p>

30 Apr 2004<br><b>Problem Sheet 20</b> (You don't have permission to access
/~houghton/TEACHING/2E2/PS-03-04/soln20.pdf on this server)Thats what happens
when I try to access problem sheet 20!<br><b>Reply</b> Fixed now, sorry!<p>

6 May 2004<br><b>End of Year Notes</b> I was wondering will you be
putting any notes online about the Trinity term lectures ( Vector
Calculus and Heat equations) ? Thx<br>
<b>Reply</b> I will put a heat equation note up sometime this week,
basically, all I cover is solving the heat equation for Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary conditions and one is covered in the solutions to the
last problem sheet and the other is in the note. I don't have any
vector calculus notes because I am never so clear as to what is needed
for this, let me know what you would like a note about and I will try to do
it. I am also hoping to get a Legendre equation note done this
week.<p>

7 May 2004<br><b>Good Luck</b> Cheers for a great year of lectures,
they have been both inspiring and surprisinly interesting for a maths
subject! hopefully we will all see you around sumtime....good luck<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks a million and all the best for the future.<p>

8 May 2004<br><b>PS 22 Q1</b> i was wondering would you be able to help
me on a problem i am workin on in maths. It involves the gauss theorem. It is
off tutorial 22 Q1.I have the solution off the net but i dont understand how
you got the answer that the cylinder has a volume of 3 pie. Is there any way
you could tell me how you got this answer. It would be of geat help to me and
i would appreciate any assistance.<br>
<b>Reply</b> So, after you apply the Gauss theorem you get -3 times
the integral of one over the cylinder, now if you integrate one over a
region you get the volume of the region; in this case we can work out
the cylinder has volume 3pi because we have a formula from the log
tables for the volume of a cylinder, it is V = pi r^2 h, where h is
the height and r is the radius.  In the question we are told that the
redius is one and that the cylinder goes from -1 to 2 on the z axis,
that means its height is three and so the volume is 3pi. Let me know
if you are still confused.<p>


11 May 2004<br><b>Problem sheets problem</b> Hi Conor, Problem sheet 23 solns seem to be faulty, they will not open correctly. <b>and</b> For some reason problem sheet 23 is not accessible!?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Actually the problem was far worse, reorganizing some
files I accidently deleted all the problem sheets and solutions,
luckily Dave Malone who is a computer guru and now my personal hero
managed to recover them and everything is fine now.<p>


14 May 2004<br><b>Convolution example</b> Dear Mr Houghton, I was in
your 2E1 maths class this year, and really enjoyed your lectures,
thank you. On going back over notes you have on your website, i found
one convolution example that i'm not sure of. In this one <br>
The convolution cos<i>t</i>*cos<i>t</i>. <a
href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~houghton/TEACHING/2E2/11Nov2001.pdf">pdf</a>
or <a
href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~houghton/TEACHING/2E2/11Nov2001.ps">ps</a>.<br>
you have that the function is equal to (cost)^2. Should it not be
(cosht)^2? it tells us that way in the tables you gave us. I just want
to make sure i'm not going about it wrong.<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for pointing this out, I don't know how long this
error has been there. Of course, equation (1) should have a plus in
it, not a minus. I will make this change straight away. Thanks again
for your help,<p>

24 May 2004<br><b>Linearization question</b> What's with this question, it was very hard.<br>
<b>Reply</b> I agree, but it will be marked very easy.<p>

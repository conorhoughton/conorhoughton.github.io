 <h2><b>Feedback</a></b></h2><p> If you would like to make
an anonymous comment on the course or the lectures, you can go to this
link. It allows you to send me email, there is a line for filling in
your email address, but you can leave it blank if you want to, the
message will still get to me.  <a target=_parent
href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~houghton/Commentform.html"> Send
Comment</a>. Of course, if you have some question that requires a
reply, fill in your email address or email me in the usual way at <a
href="mailt o:houghton@maths.tcd.ie">houghton@maths.tcd.ie</a><p> I
try to put any suitable questions I get online so everyone can see the
answer. This is linked as Q and A in the sidebar. I delete the name of
the correspondent. This also means that if you want to ask a technical
question anonymously you can read the answer on the Q and A
page. Of course, if you have a technical question, it is easiest if
you come to the front at the end of the lecture.

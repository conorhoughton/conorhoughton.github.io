<p> 16 Aug 2004<br> <b>Course.</b>
Hi, I am wondering if there is any major changes to the course for next year or is safe to start preparing / printing notes etc?
<br> <b>Reply</b>  During last two years I gave 
 almost the same course; last year I was usually within a lecture of
where I was the year before and although there were changes to the
problem sheets, the material was almost identical. I think the same
will be true this year, some of my explainations will be changed and
the problems sheets adjusted and moved around, but the material will
be the same. </p> <p>20 Oct 2004<br> <b>Integration by parts dream</b>
It was a pity about when you told us about when you dream your a
function when you get integrated by parts it's like sex(?)........your
still the man though!  <br> <b>Reply</b> I also somewhat regret
mentioning my dream, I hope hearing about it won't affect your
appreciation integration by parts. I am glad to hear that I am still
the man.</p> <p>28 Oct 2004<br> <b>Dmitri Zaitsev</b> Who is Dmitri
Zaitsev?  <br> <b>Reply</b> Who is anyone?</p> <p>2 Nov 2004<br>
<b>Number 5</b> During the lecture it was difficult to understand some
of the examples because of the use of the number 5 which looks very
similar to the letter s when written on the board.  <br> <b>Reply</b>
Sorry about that, I will try and be more careful in future.</p> <p>4
Nov 2004<br><b>Super Powers</b> You were talkin a lot about magic
potions and super powers in class, but which super power(s) would you
most like to have? PS that alice in wonderland story was classic!!
<br><b>Reply</b> So these questions continue to be a bit off topic,
but I ended up thinking a bit about what super power I would most like
and so I am going to give you what is probably a more serious answer
than you were looking for. I would like to be able to "recapture lost
time", I don't know if you have read "In search of lost time" by
Marcel Proust, but in it he talks about those moments when suddenly
you can remember exactly how you felt at some previous time, not just
what happened, or how you thought about it, but exactly how you
thought and how you felt. I think it would be great to be able to this
at will, there is all sorts of things I can remember, like, when my
son was born, or when I last spoke to my grandfather, or when my
brother came out of his coma after his accident or when I was first
dating my wife or when I was only little and used to walk with my
parents and I can remember it happening but can't put myself back into
who I was then and how I felt. Proust says it is like bridging time,
being there then and being here now. My chosen super power would be to be able to do that. Maybe that doesn't count because it doesn't help you fight crime.
</p> <p>8 Nov 2004<br><b>laws</b> i some times struggle to keep track of all the different theorems and
laws that there are and there uses. but i was wondering could you explain the
natural law.<br>
<b>Reply</b> I don't understand this question.
</p> <p>12 Nov 2004<br><b>x and s</b>
Today you changed from s's to x's when you were using the root finding
formula (excuse my ignorance for not knowing its name) for the quadratic. Is
this representation changing a step we should all do? For good practice or
something or is it all right to use s's in that formula to save time and
effort?<br>                                                                    
Thanks<br>
PS I hope you don't think this is a fruitless question. I was marked down
5% in last week's tutorial because one of my F's looked like an f.<br>
<b>Reply</b> Sorry if that was confusing. I didn't want to write <br>
s^2-2s+2=0<br>
because it isn't, when you are solving a maths problem, it is best not to write down anything that isn't true, even as an intermediate step.
I had F=s^2-2s+2 and I wanted to factorize, so I solve the corresponding quadratic equation x^2-2x+2=0, the idea is that the equation is solved by x=1-i and x=1+i so the F factorizes like (s-1+i)(s-1-i). The formula is usually called "the usual formula for solving a quadratic", I called it the Babylonian formula today, because it was discoved by the Babylonians, but that isn't really an official name. I am sorry you lost marks for writting F like an f, but if it was 5% of one tutorial it only corresponds to 0.028% of your final mark and that seems a harmless way to make the point that it is important to try and keep f and F looking different or you could easily make a mistake.</p>

<p>17 Nov 2004<br><b>Tutorials</b> Would it be possible to put the
tutorial sheet on your website before the tutorial - maybe on the
Monday? I find it diificult to finish the tutorial sheets in the
tutorial but I think if I had a chance to look at the questions in
advance it would be more useful.<br> <b>Reply</b> The fact of the
matter is that the tutorial sheets are sometimes long and sometimes it
is hard to get them finished. I do urge you to try and finish them
afterwards on your own. However, I have thought about this a bit and
discussed it with the tutors, students and others, and did try putting
them on the web first for a while, and on the whole, I think the
tutorials work better if you haven't seen the sheets before the
class.</p>

<p>30 Nov 2004<br><b>Last Week's Tutorials</b> Was there any point in
trawling through so much integration by parts in last week's tutorial?
It was really long and a pain in the ass.  <br> <b>Reply</b> I guess
the annoying answer is that it is good to practise integration by
parts. Integration by parts is like bicep curls, by improving you
control doing bicep curls improves all you upper body
exercises. Another answer to this is, it is hard to think of
convolution problems that don't involve integration by parts. On a
more general point there seems to be some anxiety in the class about
the length of the problem sheets, in fact, you aren't neccessariliy
expected to finish them every week, some weeks they are just long. In
fact, the class is doing very well on the problem sheets.</p>


<p>3 Dec 2004<br><b>Coffee</b> How much coffee do you drink per day?
<br> <b>Reply</b> Much too much. I can't lecture without it, its kind of a prop, I take a drink of coffee to cover up when I need to pause and think. Needing a prop like this is typical of an ex-smoker. Anyway, so I drink coffee everytime I lecture and then, since it is a bit addictive, I drink more and more until I start getting shaky hands and headaches. Trying to be always a bit more alert is also typical of mathematicians, the great Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdos once said that a mathematician was a machine for turning coffee into theorems. I sometimes worry that in trying to copy this I have just become a machine for turning coffee into urine.</p>
<p>11 Jan 2005<br><b>Tutorials</b> is there a 2E2 tutorial on this week??<br>
<b>Reply</b> Yes.</p>
<p>18 Feb 2005<br><b>Scholarships</b> In the course booklet it mentions how you could possibly be examined on
more than what covered in the normal course of lectures. I was just wondering
if there is anything extra we have to know for the maths exam.<br>
<b>Reply</b> No, the style of question is slightly different, less straight forward, sometimes asking for more beyond what was said in class, but the material the questions are based on is just what has been done in lectures up to the break.</p>
<p>5 March 2005<br><b>Feedback</b> how come i cant see this years feedback on your webpage? i remember looking at it earlier this year, but
cant seem to find the link to it now<br>
<b>Reply</b> I have checked and it seems to be working, also, if you can't see the feedback I don't know how I can answer your question.</p>

<p>10 March 2005<br><b>Stories</b> Is there any way you can put your stories online? They are fantastic!<br>
<b>Reply</b> Its the way I tell them! Thanks by the way.</p>

<p>15 March 2005<br><b>Scholarship</b>
Hi!<br>
2 rather late questions:<br>
   1.) Could you explain exactly why the partial fraction expansion of
       1/(s-a)^3 is A/(s+a)^3 + B/(s-a)^2 + C/(s-a) in 2004 Q2? I'm a bit
       confused...<br>
   2.) Was there some kind of mistake in the surely infamous "brown" question?
       A question who's answer can only be easily given in terms of the
       logarithm of a number defined by an accompanying cubic equation seems a
       little evil, even by schols standards...
<br>
Thanks for the help, don't worry if you don't reply before the exam.
<br>
<b>Reply</b>  So the partial fractions expansion is<br>
1/(s-a)(s-b)^3= A/(s-a)+B(s-b)+C/(s-b)^2+D/(s-b)^3<br>
you are supposed to have guessed by analogy with the 1/(s-a)(s-b)^2
example. though not required the mathematical arguement goes something
like, the cube happens when three factors come together:<br>
1/(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)<br>
before they come together you had four factors under the line, so you
needed four big letters on the right hand side,<br>
1/(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)=A/(s-a)+B/(s-b)+C/(s-c)+D/(s-d)<br>
the fact they have come together b=c=d doesn't change the number of big letters you need on the right hand side, but since b=c=d the only way to get three different denominators for the big letters to go over is to use successive powers.<br>
the brown question was extremely hard and was due to a typo in the
question, it was marked accordingly.<br>
Good luck tomorrow!</p>


<p>16 March 2005<br><b>Exam</b> On no, the exam's today!<br><b>Reply</b> None.</p>

<p>17 March 2005<br><b>Schols ARGH!</b>I never realised you could be so cruel! Since the exam is over and all... can you tell us the answer to the Z-transform question?<br>
<b>Reply</b> I didn't think the exam was any harder than previous years. I do set hard scholarship exams, it gets it out of my system before I set the Summer exam. People tend to do very well, you probably did much better than you think, for a start, getting the complex answer correct in the Z-transform question gets a good proportion of the marks even if you didn't get it into real form. I will try and put the answer up over the Easter break.<br>
<b>Further reply</b> Ok so I have done this now (24 Apr 2005), sorry about the delay.</p>

<p>24 April 2005<br><b>fight club</b> With your extensive knowledge in
the field of mathematics, can you just answer me one question, who
would win in a fight, that lad in good will hunting whos so far up his
own ass he is his own inverse, or the mad yoke in a beautiful mind who
sees all the patterns in news articles? Please give reasons for your
answer.<br>
<b>Reply</b> Actually I haven't seen either film, for some reason I don't watch films about math or read books with maths in, at a guess John Nash, the guy from a Beautiful Mind would win, he's real for a start and the other guy is made up and b) he has a job at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton and that makes him a winner.<p>

<p>24 April 2005<br><b>hi</b> just a quick note to say tnks for
explaning things so clearly during the year brilliant lectures
wouldn't have had a chance of passing exams with anyother lecturer<br>
<b>Reply</b> Wow, thanks a million! I feel kind of wierd putting this
here like I am showing off but I always try to keep the rule that I
add everything that comes from the anonymous form. At least that's my
excuse.</p>

<p>25 April 2005<br><b>summer</b>
since its summer and its going to be gettin warmer do u start wearing
all white<br>
<b>Reply</b> No, but I do have very cool sunglasses. You know you can ask questions about maths too if you want.</p>


<p>27 April 2005<br><b>tutorial sheets 19 and 20</b>
 there seems to be a problem when you click on the links for tutorial
sheets 19 and 20 you can't access the solution or the question sheet. thanks.<br><b>Reply</b> Ok, fixed now, thanks a mill for letting me know.</p>

<p>28 April 2005<br><b>Dark clothes again</b> ok this is the last unrelated maths question, but did u ever wake up at
a party or maths convention and all the other ppl there had dressed u in bright
coloured clothes<br>
<b>Reply</b> I don't get invited to that sort of maths convention and anyway, we all wear dark clothes.</p>

<p>28 April 2005<br><b>equilibrium</b> real butter or low fat butter? please give reasons<br><b>Reply</b> None.</p>


<p>28 April 2005<br><b>worried student</b> tutorial 1 question 1 should the solution of tutorial 1 question 1 not be (2/s) - (1/2s^2)<br><b>Reply</b> Yes you are right. Sorry! Thanks for pointing this out, I will change it now. Please don't worry!</p>


<p>2 May 2005<br><b>Tutorial</b> Is there a tutorial tomorrow morning?<br><b>Reply</b> Yes, but it won't be me teaching it.</p>

<p>4 May 2005<br><b>exam '02</b>
 I was wondering if there is a possibility that a question similar to
question 4 on the 2002 exam paper making an appearence this year? Its the one
with the diagram and I cant really make out what is going on in the set of
model answers for that questio, though I think there may be a mistake in it
since it says to put in w twice and later refers to a u which seems to have
come out of nowhere.  Cheers too for a great year, if only other lecturers
could make their courses seem as easy, I'd pass 2E3 with flying colours!<br>
<b>Reply</b> Sorry for the delay in replying to this, I have been away. The simple answer to your question is that I used to do more Z-transforms than I do now, this was changed to make time for the heat equation. These questions are related to signal processing, one of the applications of the Z-transform, if you do electronic you do them again later on. The u_k is the name of one of the intermediate outputs, this isn't particularily clear in the answer given but would have been clear if you had seen a few of these before.</p>

<p>5 May 2005<br> <b>Extreme Integration</b>
I've just watched Toy Story again and couldn't help but wonder are we
ever going to do any integrals to infinity and beyond?<br>
<b>Reply</b> So the thing that bugs me about toy story, apart from, what are the rules about being a toy and why does Buzz obey them if he doesn't know he is a toy, is this; in the final chase scene the control for the remote control car is left behind, condemning the car to the attic or top shelf, but this is never commented on, nobody cares! Why are we supposed to care more about Buzz and Woody than about the toy car? As someone who watches Pixar films alot, like an awful lot, I think MI and Nemo are superior and I have yet to watch the Incredibles without a tear in my eye.</p>

<p>6 May 2005<br><b>Clothes</b>
I was wondering why you always wear black and I think it has somthing
to do with Einstein. He used to wear the the same clothes all the time, that
is, he had seven sets of the same suit,shirt and socks etc. He did this because
he didn't want to have waste any mental energy in the morning on deciding on
what to wear (he obviously had more important things to think about). Is this
why you only wear black?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Is it a coincidence that the Fly was on TV last week? I don't think so.</p>

<p>9 May 2005<br><b>Q3 2004</b> 
outline solution to question 3, 2004 paper, line (2). where did the 3
in the numerator disappear to ? please let me know<br>
<b>Reply</b> It is still there! I left it out in eqn (3) where I did the partial fractions but it is included in (4) where I add the two partial fractions together.</p>

<p>9 May 2005<br><b>More nonesense</b> 
well this space does say write about "body".
U've lost alot of weight recently, well done but do be careful.
We don't want u wasting away on us !<br>
<b>Reply</b> Ok.</p>

<p>9 May 2005<br><b>2001/2003 question 3</b>
back again sorry.
On the 2001 paper Q3b has me stuck .
It is similar to q3a 2003, which unfortunatly has me stuck too.
I can't seem to fill in the logical steps between the lines of ur solution
(series and sequences have always been a weakness with me).
Could u offer me a longer step by srep solution please<br>
<b>Reply</b> So this just goes back to the definition of the Z-transform. If you have a sequence (x_0,x_1,x_2,. . .) then its Z-transform is x_0+x_1/z_x_2/z^2+. . .. Now, in this example you are told that the Z-transform is<br> 
(z^5+13z^2+2)/z^6=1/z+13/z^4+2/z^6.<br> 
If we compare this to the Z-transform formula:<br>
Z(x_k)=x_0+x_1/z+x_2/z^2+x_3/z^3+x_4/z^4+x_5/z^5+x_6/z^6+x_7/z^7+ . . .<br>
we see that this is the Z-transform of a sequence with only three non-zero entries: normally there are an infinite number of nonzero entries; hence we can read of the entries, x_0=0 because the Z-transform has no term without z's, x_1=1 because it has 1/z, x_2=0 because there is no 1/z^2 term and so on, giving<br>
(x_k)=(0,1,0,0,13,0,2,0,0,. . .)</p>

<p>14 May 2005<br><b>heat flow eqn</b> 
just looking at the heat flow equation questions from 04/03, the
equation is du/dt= d^2u/d^t but in the solution and from my notes taken in
class you have it as du/dt=d^2u/d^2x, is this the correct way or are they
different equations?<br>
<b>Reply</b> Misprint, corrected on the day, it should of course have been du/dt=d^2u/dx^2.</p>  


<p>15 May 2005<br><b>Thanks for everything!</b> 
hi, i just want to express my appreciation for a great course taught by
a great lecturer! im sure i speak for everyone when i say you are by far the
best lecturer we have ever had! Although a lot of people missed a lot of
lectures, 2e2 was something everyone made an effort to go to! In other subjects
people seem to go to the lectures so they dont feel guilty about missing them,
but with 2e2 we actually come out knowing what the lecture was about, which is,
unfortunately, quite unusual! your notes from the lectures are also brilliant,
the comments you add, in plain english, really help with the difficult parts!
Also, i found the tutorials great, when everyone has to do them together it
means even the slowest people(myself included) know how to do them! As we're
coming up to exam time i'm really starting to appreciate your solutions to past
exam papers, great notes and just being able to remember how to do the stuff,
which, again is quite unusual! it makes 2e2 a pleasure (well, relatively
speaking anyway!) to learn, i find myself getting excited about my 2e2 days!!
Just wondering if you went to some sort of "being a good lecturer course" to
learn all this, and if you did could you pass the number on to some of our
other lecturers (not mentioning any names!!!), who seem to have trouble not
only with lecturing but also with simple things such as writing on each board
in sequence(im sure the class knows who i'm talking about!) which surprises me,
considering maths is such a logical subject!(oops, you can probably guess who
it is now coz i said maths!)<br>
Thanks again, you're a star!<br>
Also, talking about toy story, my favourite wasn't buzz or woody or even the
poor car, but mr potato head coz i had one of them when i was younger and he
was one of my favourite toys...i never dreamed he'd star in a movie!! i wonder
where he is actually...i haven't seen him in a few years...<br>
<br><b>Reply</b> Thanks for your kind remarks, I certainly enjoyed teaching the course this year. If anyone has any critisms of the course or suggestions how it should be improved, let me know.</p>

<p>18 May 2005<br><b>gauss divergence</b> 
hi just wondering if you could put up a solution for the 2004 gauss
problem (Q.8). it's with a spere think i know how to do it but would appreciate
it if you could give a solutuion. is it  just a matter of getting the div f and
then integrating over the vol where the limits go fomr 0-1????or is it more
complex???<br>
<b>Reply</b> It is actually less complex, you are integrating the div F=-5 over a sphere, the integral of one over a region is the volume of the region,
here the region has volume 4 pi/3 since the sphere has unit radius, so,
the answer is -20 pi/3. I will add this solution this evening,</p>



<p>18 May 2005<br><b>Determinants</b> 
In our 2e1 course to find the determinant we used the characteristic
eqn [(lambda)I-A]. Is this the same as using [A-(lambda)I] as we did with you?
Thanx<br>
																											     <b>Reply</b> Yes, it is exactly the same, for a two by two matrices M det(M)=det(-M), for three by three there is an extra minus detM=-det(-M) but since you are solving det(lambda I-A)=0 an overall minus makes no difference.</p>


<p>18 May 2005<br><b>Heat equation</b> 
hey are u going to stick up notes on heat equations and all that
milarky. u stopped after bessel equation.<br>
<b>Reply</b> I put a heat equation problem sheet and answer on the problem sheet page, last year I put up a problem sheet and a note because I did both types of boundary conditions, this year I did only Dirichlet conditions so I didn't put up the note in case it confused people. Is there anything else you feel needs a note?</p>

<p>19 May 2005<br><b>Eigenvectors</b>
 When evaluating eigenvectors i.e for a and b, if you have an equation
for e.g b=-ia which is the same as a=ib, if you let a=1 in the first you get
b=-i. in the seccond if you let b=1 you get a=i, these produce two different
eigenvectors. how do you know which to use, i.e how do you prevent yourself
from making a mistake with this? if you could clear this upit would be much
appreciated. Thanks.<br>
<b>Reply</b> The two eigenvectors only differ by an overall scalar, in this case i so it makes no difference. The only thing to watch is that if you are using two eigenvectors to a real matrix, it is more covenient to take them to be conjugates.</p>   

<p>20 May 2005 <b>Series</b> 
In the series solutions question when do you sub in y=sigma(a+^n) and when do
you sub in y=sigma(at^n+r), whats the difference. Is the second only when doing
the bessel equation or the method of frobenius? Otherwise can I always sub in
y=sigma(a+^n). I get worried that I don't make the right substitution  or do i
have to worry about this at all?<br>
<b>Reply</b>The r is only used for the method of Frobenius, it gives extra freedom
which helps when there is a problem with the normal method. In short,
sometimes, for example for the Bessel equation, the normal
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nt^n substitution doesn't give the correct number of
solutions, in those cases you need to try \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nt^{n+r} and
you can choose r at the end to get the right number of solutions. In the
exam you will be told if Frobenius is needed, in the future, if you end up
using these methods, you would be alerted to the need for Frobenius if you
get to the end and a_0 or a_1 is set to zero, in addition there are tests
you can learn that allow you to tell if the method of Frobenius is
going to be needed.</p>

<p>24 May 2005<br><b>Log tables</b> 
I would like to let you know that we had a log tables taken from us
during our 2E1 exam today. Apparently it has to be said now on the paper.
I'm sure your paper says they are allowed, but just in case!<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for this. Don't worry, its on the front of the paper.</p>

<p>24 May 2005<br><b>you</b> 
with the eve of the exam upon me, i would like to say thank you for
being the best lecturer in engineering (with a possible exception of andrew
torrance) . . . . ! rock on you legend!<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for your kind remarks, I will mention this to Andrew. Hope all goes well tomorrow.</p>

<p>25 May 2005<br><b>exam</b>  
You're probably getting sick of this now (or just a massive head) but I
also just want to say thanks for being such a great lecturer and making the
course enjoyable. Thanks also for not making the exam too hard! Enjoy your
summer!<br>
<b>Reply</b> Thanks for your kind remarks, I am glad you feel the exam went well.</p>

<p>25 May 2005<br><b>Weren't in the exam</b> How come you didn't come
in to the exam(room 5052), i had some questions to ask?<br>
<b>Reply</b> I am very sorry, this results from a misunderstanding on
my part. If this happens, do not hesitate to ask the invigilator to
contact the lecturer's department. Please let me know what you found
confusing in the exam paper and I will take any potential ambiguities
into account when marking all the exam scripts.</p>

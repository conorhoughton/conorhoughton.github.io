<h2><b>Recommended textbooks</b></h2> </p>
<p> 
The main texbook is <b>Erwin Kreyszig</b>, <i>Advanced Engineering
Mathematics</i>. The page reference I give are to the 8th edition. For
Z-tranforms I use <b>Glyn James</b>, <i>Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics</i> with page references refering to the second edition. I
am hoping to put enough notes on the web to make looking at this book
unnecessary.</p>

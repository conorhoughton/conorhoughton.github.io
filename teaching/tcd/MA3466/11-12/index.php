<p><b>I now see that the exam questions were very long and will mark accordingly</b></p>
<p>This lecture course will mostly deal with closely follow material in </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Elements of Information Theory</i> by Thomas Cover and Joy Thomas.
</ul>
<p>It is lectured by me, Conor Houghton; this is the third year it is being taught. It will be examined by an end of year exam. The course was taught before in 07-08 when it was called <b>472</b></p>

<p><b>Draft course description:</b> Information theory is the mathematical
study of the statistical structure of data, typical questions
addressed by information theory include "how much can English language
text be compressed" or "how similar are these two probability
distributions". As a discipline in mathematics it overlaps with
electronic engineering, computer science and neuroscience. This course
will provide an introduction to information theory based in the
standard text book Cover and Thomas, it will cover chapters 2, 3 and
4, along with material from chapters 5 and 6. Information theory uses
many ideas from statistics but no previous knowledge of statistics
will be assumed. </p>

<p>My email address is houghton@maths.tcd.ie and my office is at the
top of the maths department, half way between the discussion room and
Donal O'Donavan's office. If you want to contact me anonymously, for
example to complain about the course, you can use the feedback
facility linked from the sidebar. I also intend to give a one line
description of each lecture as I go along; again, this is linked from
the side bar. The chapter list in the course description may be
changed when I see how quickly the material is being covered.</p>

  <p><b>2024-12-05</b></p>
  <p>End-of-year walk, we wandered down to the floating harbour and had coffee and hot chocolate in Watershed.</p>
<p><br></p>
  <p><b>2024-12-03</b></p>
  <p>Joint lab meetin with Cian's group, Andrew talked about his efforts to understand the Byrne-Coombs ansatz.</p>
<p><br></p>
  <p><b>2024-11-29</b></p>
  <p>I gave a short presentation on "Reflections on language evolution: From minimalism to pluralism" by Cedric Boeckx; I am reviewing this book for the linguist mailing list so I used this as an opportunity to rehearse some of my arguments; Seth Bullock came as a guest. The slides are available at:</p>

  <p><b>2024-11-19</b></p>
  <p>A joint lab meeting with Cian's group; Kipp gave us an update on his work.</p>
<p><br></p>
  <p><b>2024-11-15</b></p>
  <p>Kimberley described her work on using ELO ranking to rate the significance of the `significant events' we have collected as part of her series of experiments. The process seems to work, the good statements rise to the top, the poor ones fall to the bottom. It is less clear how to assess equilibrium, the statements look like they've equilibriated but we need to think about how we can be sure. Sophie Baker came as a guest.</p>

  <p><b>2024-11-08</b></p>
  <p>We discussed the topic of my upcoming debate with Jeff Bowers as part of Se&acute;n Froudist-Walsh's unit "Cognitive AI":</p>
  <p>Is psychology or neuroscience more important to consider when building models of human intelligence></p>
  <p>I am to debate the "neuroscience" side. The strategy will be to concede that psychology has framed the question and will determined its outcome, but has proved useless at actually making progress on it. New ideas must come from facts, while neuroscience is boring, psychology is useless.</p>

  <p>Joint lab meeting with Cian's group, a catch up!</p>
<p><br></p>
  <p><b>2024-11-01</b></p>
  <p>George led a discussion of his new project, now funded by the Jean Golding Institute:</p>

  <p><b>2024-10-25</b></p>
  <p>We watched this talk:</p>
  <p>Michael C Frank. Bridging the Data Gap Between Children and AI Models</p>
  from last years CCN. He tries to work out how to train models on the same stimuli children train on, his main contribution is collecting and curating huge amounts of child point-of-view video and audio using a custom-made helmet mount for a GoPro. The models don't learn as much from this as the child; is this surprising? He claims it is and tries to pin down why, it seems so far from being likely to work that it is unlikely to help work out the difference. Cool data though and nice to formulate the problem so precisely.</p>

  <p><b>2024-10-18</b></p>
<p>We looked at this amazing paper:</p>

<p>Goldin-Meadow, Susan, and Heidi Feldman. The creation of a communication system: A study of deaf children of hearing parents. Sign Language Studies 8.1 (1975): 225-233.<p>
<p>which describes a variant of the forbidden experiment - parents, note, it is forbidden for a reason - in which the hearing parents under the foolish and damaging oralist delusion raise their deaf children without any contact with sign language. The children, denied any real language turn their parents' unconscious gestures into signs and these signs into the start of a language, as evidenced by the children's use of two gesture phrases when the parents use the gestures in isolation, and by there consistent ordering of the gestures by type, as shown in this graph.

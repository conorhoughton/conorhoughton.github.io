	thinking</b>; this is surprisingly hard to pin down and I
	believe asking people about what they feel is going on in
	their own heads might be useful. I am intending to have a
	series of structured conversations with people to see what we
	learn that way. This website will present the transcripts of
	those conversations. The proceedure for posting these
	transcripts includes a period when participants have the
	opportunity to withdraw their interview and so it will be some
	  time before any transcripts actually appear.</p></td>

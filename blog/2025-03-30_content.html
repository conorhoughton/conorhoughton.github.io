<p><b>The persistence of mystical thinking</b></p>

<p>While I was at the <b>Turing Institute</b>'s AI-UK conference I
went to an interesting workshop on the ethical challenge presented by
machine consciousness; it's a testament to a certain can-do spirit
that this challenge, impossible to define and extraordinarily
difficult to think about has a not-for-profit: The Partnership for
Research into Sentient Machines (PRiSM).</p>

<p>I was very struck by one of the group activities. We were given a
set of pictures, a person, a toddler, a parrot, a dog, a fish, a rock, a tree,
an autonomous drone, an LLM-powered assistant, a
foetus, a bacterium; more I can't remember. The task was to order them
  by how conscious they are. Of course, there is a tragic inclination
among academics sat around a table, and these were mostly but not
totally academics, to respond to an ordering task by deciding there
needs to be two dimensions and then argue about what those two
dimensions should be called. Nonetheless we eventually managed the
task.</p>

<p>The first surprise, for me, was that no one spoke up for the
foetus, it was placed, with total accord and little hesitation at the
right-hand, lacking consciousness, end of the range, just above rocks
and about level with the tree. This seems a complete defeat for the
view that a foetus has a soul and shares the sin of Adam, and, even if
it had no power to reason, having a soul would make it
conscious. Indeed, a Christian view, or at least the Catholic view I
heard about in school, might create just two piles rather than a
continuum, the person, the toddler and the foetus, conscious; the
rest, from parrot down to rock, not. No one suggested that and, it
seems, a particular religious view of the world is dead, or at least,
no one at my table seemed to even consider it.</p>

<p>However, religious, or at least vitalist thinking is not dead. This
also surprised me; everyone agreed that there was something special
about life, about living things. The AIs, even the futuristic
LLM-powered assistant, were put on the right, the non-conscious end,
  along with rocks and trees. All the animals were stretched out
in roughly the order of how clever they seem. Consciousness, it
seems, is an exclusive property of biological, living, things and is
possessed in proportion to the ability to reason. Consciousness exists
in the absence of language and language does not grant
consciousness!</p>

<p>I can't imagine what justifies this; an LLM has so many of the
attributes of consciousness, a fish almost none. Setting the fish
above the LLM feels like a mystical belief in a spirit, a breath of
life!</p>

<p><b>A rare example of Occitan.</b></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I visited the Vézère valley;
I was at the FRCCS conference in Bordeaux and I wanted to see
Lascaux. The cave, or at lest the cave facsimile was wonderful, but
not the subject here; I had known that story of the teenagers and
their dog finding the caves in 1940, I hadn't known that one, Simon
Emmanuel Coencas, was Jewish and got caught up in, but thanksfully
survived, the horror that entailed. I also hadn't realised the boys
  spoke Occitan, not French.</p>

<p>It is a shock to be reminded how recently Occitan was spoken and
how suddenly it seemed to vanish. Before the first world
  war it was widely spoken in the Dordogne,  it is the inheritor of a
rich medieval troubadour tradition and a nineteenth century literary
revival but after the second world war it was
becoming rare and now it has all but vanished. Vanished and vanished
without a trace, it does not appear as a second language on street
signs, or a ritualized if rarely read extra passage on official
notices.</p>

<p>I did find one remenant, the plaque above by a school in Les 
Eyzies; I can't find anything more about Gabrial Lafon but by 1971
when the plaque was put up the language it was written in had all but
disappeared. I wonder if languages have always disappeared as often as
have over the last two centuries; perhaps what has changed is not that
languages are more likely to disappear but that they are less likely
to be created. However, whether this is a consequence of modernity, or
part of a timeless rule that dooms most languages, it is sad to
imagine all the languages we have losts, each its own little world, each a delicate fusing of culture and the broken-logic of grammar.</p>

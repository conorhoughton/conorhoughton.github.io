<p><b>Orange.</b></p>
l
<p>The word for orange in Arabic is <i>burtuq&#257;l</i>; standard Arabic has no "p" sound and this word comes for <i>Portugal</i> because the Portugese were the first to bring oranges in large amounts to places people spoke Arabic!</p>

<p>I learned this recently because I was in Amsterdam and was
surprised to discover Dutch has different words for orange the
colour: <i>oranje</i> and orange the fruit: <i>sinaasappel</i>, from
Chinese apple. I had thought all European languages had the same word,
that none of them had words for the colour orange until the fruit
  arrived.</p>

<p>It turns out the story is much more complicated and in the usual
glossomantic way, a little slice of our vast history. Our word,
orange, is not derived as I have long believe, from the fruit we eat,
the sweet orange.  It is based instead on the Arabic word for the
bitter orange, the related fruit that is used to make marmalade,
orange oils and candied peels: it is too bitter to be eaten, as is,
for pleasure. The cultivars and know how for growing the bitter orange
tree spread along the silk road and arrived in Southern Europe around
tenth century. This fruit had a name that had made the same journey as
the tree, from Sanskrit, through Persian to Arabic.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sanskrit</strong>: <span lang="sa">नारङ्ग</span> — <i>n&#257;ra&#7749;ga</i></li>
  <li><strong>Persian (historical)</strong>: <span lang="fa" dir="rtl">نارنگ</span> — <i>n&#257;rang</i></li>
  <li><strong>Arabic (medieval)</strong>: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">نارنج</span> — <i>n&#257;ranj</i></li>
</ul>
This becamse Spanish <i>naranja</i> and ultimately <i>orange</i>. It
lost the "n" to an article, you can imagine "a norange" getting mixed
up with "an orange"; this is more-or-less what happened but it
happened before the word reached English.</p>

<p>However, the use of orange as a word for a colour did begin until
after the sweet orange arrived during the age of exploration,
beginning in the fifteen century. Before that time journeys took too
long to carry a fruit as perishable as an orange, bitter or sweet,
across long distances; transportation was also expensive and more
appropriate for things with high-value, spices and glazed
pottery. This meant the bitter orange was unknown in the Netherlands
so when Portuguese traders arrived in France with sweet oranges they
were named after their bitter relatives, in the Netherlands, however,
  they were named after the place they came from  <i>sinaasappel</i>.</p>

<p>The age of exploration was a time of vast change, of expansion and
with that languages expanded to not just encompass words for new
animals, new objects and new plants; new adjectives were also
needed. With the popularity and prestige of the sweet orange came a
new colour word: <i>orange</i>. This word started in France or England
and spread, in countries where the sweet orange had a name like
orange, it took the same word as for the fruit, in countries like the
Netherlands, where the fruit had a completely different name, the
colour was named, or invented, with a different word to the word for
the fruit.</p>

<p>The surprising thing is that Portugese merchants were so closely
associated with sweet oranges some languages named the fruit after
Portugal: Armenian, Modern Standard Arabic and many other forms of
Arabic, modern Persian, some Slavic languages, Greek, Georgian,
Albanian and Turkish. In some of these languages the colour is named
after the bitter orange, in Persian it is <span lang="fa"
dir="rtl">نارنجی</span> — <i>n&#257;ranj&#299;</i> and in
Turkish <i>turuncu</i>; the Turkish word for bitter
orange, <i>turunç</i>, comes from the same Sanskrit source as orange
but has been on a longer phonetic journey. The others, MSA and so on,
all name the colour after the sweet orange.</p>

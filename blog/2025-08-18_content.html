<p><b>Orange.</b></p>

<p>The word for orange in Arabic is <i>burtuq&#257;l</i>; standard
Arabic has no "p" sound and this word comes for <i>Portugal</i>
because the Portugese were the first to bring oranges in large quantities
to places where people spoke Arabic!</p>

<p>I learned this because I was in Amsterdam and was surprised to
discover Dutch has different words for orange the
colour: <i>oranje</i> and orange the fruit: <i>sinaasappel</i>, from
Chinese apple. I had thought all European languages had the same word
for the fruit and the colour because none of them had words for the
colour orange until the fruit arrived.</p>

<p>It turns out the story is more complicated and in the usual
glossomantic way, the story of the word is a little slice of our vast
history. Our word, orange, is not derived as I have long believe, from
the fruit we eat, the sweet orange.  It is based instead on the Arabic
word for the bitter orange, the related fruit that is used to make
marmalade, orange oils and candied peels: it is too bitter to be
eaten for pleasure. The cultivars and know-how for growing the
bitter orange tree spread along the silk road and arrived in Southern
Europe around the tenth century. This fruit had a name that had made the
same journey as the tree, from Sanskrit, through Persian to Arabic.
<ul>
  <li>Sanskrit: <span lang="sa">नारङ्ग</span> — <i>n&#257;ra&#7749;ga</i></li>
  <li>Persian (historical): <span lang="fa" dir="rtl">نارنگ</span> — <i>n&#257;rang</i></li>
  <li>Arabic (medieval): <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">نارنج</span> — <i>n&#257;ranj</i></li>
</ul>
This becamse Spanish <i>naranja</i> and ultimately <i>orange</i>. It
lost the "n" to an article, you can imagine "a norange" getting mixed
up with "an orange"; this is more-or-less what happened but it
happened before the word reached English.</p>

<p>However, the use of orange as a word for a colour did begin until
after the sweet orange arrived during the age of exploration,
beginning in the fifteen century. Before it took too long to carry a
fruit as perishable as an orange, bitter or sweet, across long
distances; transportation was also expensive and more appropriate for
things with high-value like spices and glazed pottery. This meant the
bitter orange was unknown in the Netherlands. Thus when Portuguese
traders arrived in France with sweet oranges they were named after
their bitter relatives but in the Netherlands they were named after
the place they came from <i>sinaasappel</i>.</p>

<p>The age of exploration was a time of vast change and languages
expanded to not just encompass words for new animals, new objects and
new plants; new adjectives were also needed. With the popularity and
prestige of the sweet orange came a new colour
word: <i>orange</i>. This word started in France or England and
spread. This meant that countries ended up with the same word for the
fruit and the colour, some, like Holland, did not.</p>

<p>Portugese merchants were so closely associated with sweet oranges
some languages named the fruit after Portugal: Armenian, Modern
Standard Arabic and many other forms of Arabic, modern Persian, some
Slavic languages, Greek, Georgian, Albanian and Turkish. In some of
these languages the colour is named after the bitter orange, in
Persian it is <span lang="fa" dir="rtl">نارنجی</span>
— <i>n&#257;ranj&#299;</i> and in Turkish <i>turuncu</i>; the Turkish
word for bitter orange, <i>turunç</i>, comes from the same Sanskrit
source as orange but has been on a longer phonetic journey. The
others, MSA and so on, all name the colour after the sweet orange even
though, in the case of Arabic, there was already a word for bitter
orange, one that gave the colour its name in many languages.</p>

<p>As for Dutch, the prominence of orange is a pun; the <i>House of
    Orange</i> has a different origin to the fruit: it comes
    from <i>Arausio</i>, the name of a Celtic god. Words can undergo
    something like gulling, that mysterious force that causes boats to
    drift together: in this case this process pushed Arausio to become
    "Orange" and then inspired the princes of Orange to use that colour
    in their banners. Ultimately this same orange ended up on the
    Irish flag. As a testiment of how important words and symbols are,
    my teachers in National School in the middle of the Troubles used
    to tell us the colour was amber, not orange; related to papal
    yellow not protestant orange. These days I find that ironic since
    amber seems to be colour that only exists in England.</p>

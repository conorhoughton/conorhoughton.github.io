<p><b>My favourite thing in the Bristol Museum.</b> I think everyone's favourite thing in the Bristol Museum is the imitation Dodo and I love the friezes from Nimrod to the point of making visitors come and admire them. However, my absolute favourite is an Egyptian coffin base with the beautiful hieroglyphs pictured above.</p>

<p>The coffin base is on display with the coffin lid, the lid is
elaborately painted. It seems the mummy itself is lost, but we are
told the coffin dates from between 675 and 640 BCE, came from Thebes,
and belonged to ly-en-Amen-nay-es-nebet-ta, Lady of the House,
daughter of Goldworker. We aren't told what the hieroglyphs on the
base mean, but perhaps they are the source for this information.</p>

<p>675 to 640 BCE spans the division between the 25th and the 26th
Dynasties. The 25th Dynasty, the Nubian Dynasty, originating from the
lower Nile, far from Thebes, lasted from around 744 to 656 BCE and ended with an
Assyrian invasion, the 26th Dynasty, the Saite Dynasty, was founded in
664 BCE and lasted until 525 BCE when Egypt was conquered by the
Persians. While these two dynasties marked the last great resurgence
in Egyptian art and culture, the period in which this coffin was
created was not kind Thebes, it was sacked in 663 BCE, partially
destroyed and plundered by Assyrian forces.</p>

<p>For all of this, the hieroglphs are enchanting! The script is so
lively, natural and expressive; it is wonderful to look at something
so utterly lost in time and culture but beautiful in a way that
remains moving.</p>

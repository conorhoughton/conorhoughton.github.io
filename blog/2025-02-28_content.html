<p><b>The typography of terror</b>. You have to admire this. The
script is perfect; almost fraktur, it is a nod towards a military,
German, angularity with a heavy blackness that expresses a bristling,
  militaristic worldview, while avoiding the obviousiness, the elaborate `design-ness' that would have come with actual frakture.<p>

<p>Donegall Pass is an interesting street, it starts in the new
Belfast, Asian groceries, student restaurants, a messy lively
place. At the other end it has this gable, some large surface car
parks, I imagine people are land-banking and a loyalist bar I saw a
marching band standing around outside with pipes, drums and pints.</p>

<p>Republician grafetti often shows an influence of the cl&acute;
Gaelach, the Repubician sacrifice is often individual, martyrs dead for a dream, a story. Loyalist grafetti is about defiance, a community; a fortress. Here we see the bars; letters made of steel.</p>

<p>I love this sign in the cl&oacute; Gaelach, the old script:<p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sgoil Naisi&uacute;nta Tamhaine<br>
An t-athair Seumus &Oacute; Cathain PP"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tawin national school is a single room school on Tawin Island, a
beautiful desolate place about 10km from Oranmore, the teacher was a
neighbour of mine when I was a boy. You can see Galway bay in three
directions from the school house and the margin where the sea and land
compete over inlets and headlands, tufted hillocks and sea grass,
hooded crows and wading birds, decaying wooden boat hulls and
abandoned fishing weirs, is familiar beyond words to my memory. It is
the windswerpt ancient look of land-meets-sea along west coast of
Ireland. It is what I am sick for when I am homesick.</p>

<p>The sign too is a competition, the elegance of the script competing with the cack-handedness of the layout, the scrabble to fit in the PP, the weird gap between the "S" and "g" in Sgoil. The "g" when "school" is now scoil was it seems was fairly standard before the spelling reforms, sc&eacute;al too was sometimes sg&eacute;al, and Seumus was a common variant of Se&aacute;mus.</p>

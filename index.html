  <p>(2024-09-24) A paper about evolution!</p>
  <p>
  <i>Cooperation as well as learning: A commentary on 'How learning can guide evolution' by Hinton and Nowlan</i><br>
  Conor Houghton<br>
  (To appear Complex Systems, 2024)<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15609">arXiv: 2409.15609</a></p>
  <p>According to the <b>Baldwin Effect</b> learning can guide
    evolution: being able to learn a trait can help a species
    evolve that same trait. This at first feels like Lemarkian
    nonsense, but it isn't.</p>
  <p>Lets consider a very artificial example; imagine it is useful for
  a hen to be able recognize a snake and then stand up tall and
  dinosaur-like to scare it off. Imagine further, and implausibly,
  that each of these two traits can be produced by a single mutation.
  Eevery so often a hen is hatched that can recognize a snake. This
  trait does it no good since it doesn't know how to scare off that
  same snake. Similarly, imagine on other occasions a hen is hatched
  that can scare off snakes; again this trait is useless, it is no
  good knowing how to scare of a snake if you don't know how to spot
  one. Sadly it is much much rarer that a hen is hatched that has both
  traits at once and so the useless individual traits disappear from
  the population and evolutionary change does not produce snake-safe hens..</p>
<p> Now imagine that a hen can also learn, though experience, to scare
off snakes, learning the required tall stance after a few close
calls. In this case, inheriting the mutation that allows a hen to
recognize a snake is useful, when it recognizes the snake and with a
few frightening encounters and a little luck, it can learn to scare
snakes off. Thus the potential to learn how to scare snakes makes the
recognizing-snakes mutation useful and so this mutation will provide
fitness and in the usual Darwinian way spread through the
population. Furthermore, once the hens can recognize snakes, the
mutation that makes them instinctively stand tall to scare snakes
becomes useful too, it saves them the risky encounters required to
learn the trait by experince. In this way, the fact they can learn the
traits makes the species more likely to evolve this. This is the Baldwin
  Effect.</p>
<p>In 1987 <b>Hinton and Nowlan</b> wrote a very elegant paper
describing the Baldwin Effect and illustrating it with a nice
  mathematical simulations.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.complex-systems.com/abstracts/v01_i03_a06/">Complex Systems</a></p>
  <p>This paper was influential, it formed part of the argument in <b>Pinker and Bloom</b>'s powerful argument that language evolved through normal Darwinian mechanisms:</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/natural-language-and-natural-selection/CDD84686D58AF70E3D2CB48486D7940B">Behavioral and Brain Sciences</a></p>
<p>In my paper I point out that there is a <b>similar effect with
cooperation</b>. Perhaps in a flock of hens one hen gets the mutation
that allows it to recognize a snake and when it sees one it squawks in
alarm, another hen has the mutation that makes standing tall when
under threat instinctive and so it scares of the snake. Both traits
are benefitial and the usual Darwinian, survivalist, principles mean
that they will become established. The two mutations are much more
likely to occur in the same time in flock than in one individual
animal. My paper uses the same sort of simulations described by Hinton
and Nowlan to illustrate this effect. Thus, in addition to the obvious
benefits of social behaviour in animals, cooperation all broadens the
evolutionary path to complex behaviours.</p>

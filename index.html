  <i>Modeling nonlinear oscillator networks using physics-informed hybrid reservoir computing.</i><br>
  Andrew Shannon, Conor Houghton, David Barton, Martin Homer<br>
  (Under review, 2024)<br>

<p>
Modelling dynamical systems using differential equations is often,
maybe even typically, difficult; we don't know all the terms in the
equations, we don't all the parameters. The modern alternative is to
give it to a neural network, maybe an RNN; however, this can be a
disaster, the RNN will learn the training data but find some cunning
way to draw bizarre conclusions about what the system would do in just
slightly different circumstances to the ones in the data. The neural
network also commits the twin crimes of ignore our existing intuition
for the behaviour of the system and supplies no new qualitative insight into what's going on.</p>
  <p>Here we consider a hybrid; a neural network
    coupled to a
differential equation. If we used a `proper' RNN with end-to-end
training it would just take over and not leave anything for the
  differential equations. Instead we use a reservoir computer, a recurrent neural network with fixed connections: all that is learned in a final read out layer. This follows the ideas described in:</p>
  <p>Karniadakis, G. E. et al. Physics-informed machine learning. Nature Reviews Physics 3, 422-440 (2021).</p>
  <p>We test this physics-informed hybrid reservoir computing approach
  on an oscillating system: these have lots of applications including
  the application we ultimately have in mind, EEG signals recorded
  from the brain. We use a system of Kuramoto oscillators, so the idea
  is that the hybrid system includes a module, the expert model, which
  includes the differential equations for the Kuramoto
  oscillators. However, the ground truth, the thing we are trying to
  model, has an extra non-linear coupling: this represents extra
  physics that the modeller doesn't know about. This is a stern test,
    the extra term changes the behaviour making the expert model useless on its own. The question is whether the reservoir can compensate?</p>
  <p>The answer is a bit complicated: the hybrid is mostly better than
  the alternative of using just the reservoir or just the expert model
  and the hybrid is much less sensitive to the choice of parameters,
  but all three approaches struggle a bit with the task.</p>

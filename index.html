  <i>Modeling nonlinear oscillator networks using physics-informed hybrid reservoir computing.</i><br>

Modelling dynamical systems using differential equations is often,
maybe even typically, difficult: we don't know all the terms in the
equations, we don't all the parameters. The modern alternative is to
give the problem to a neural network, maybe an RNN; however, this can be a
disaster, the RNN will learn the training data perfectly but find some cunning
way to draw bizarre conclusions about what the system would do in just
slightly different circumstances to the ones in the data. The neural
network also commits the twin crimes of ignore our existing intuition
for the behaviour of the system and supplies no new qualitative insight into what's going on.</p>
<p><img src="images/hybridSchematic.png" alt="Hybrid Schematic" width="600px"></p>
  <p>Here we consider a hybrid; a neural network coupled to an expert
    model: the system of differential equations we believe captures
    some important aspects of the behaviour. If we used a `proper' RNN
    with end-to-end training it would just take over and not leave
    anything for the differential equations. Instead we use a
    reservoir computer, a recurrent neural network with fixed
    connections: all that is learned in a final read out layer. This
    follows the ideas described in:</p>
  <p>Pathak, J. et al. Hybrid forecasting of chaotic processes: Using machine learning in conjunction with a knowledge-based model. Chaos 28, 041101 (2018)<br>
  <p>Karniadakis, G. E. et al. Physics-informed machine learning. Nature Reviews Physics 3, 422-440 (2021).</p>
  <p>We test this <b>physics-informed hybrid reservoir computing</b> approach
  on an oscillating system: these have lots of applications including
  the application we ultimately have in mind, EEG signals recorded
  from the brain. We use a system of Kuramoto oscillators, so the idea
  is that the hybrid system includes a module, the expert model, which
  includes the differential equations for the Kuramoto
  oscillators. However, the ground truth, the thing we are trying to
  model, has an extra non-linear coupling: this represents extra
  physics that the modeller doesn't know about. This is a stern test,
    the extra term changes the behaviour making the expert model useless on its own. The question is whether the reservoir can compensate?</p>
  <p>The answer is a bit complicated: the hybrid is mostly better than
  the alternative of using just the reservoir or just the expert model
  and the hybrid is much less sensitive to the choice of parameters,
    but all three approaches struggle a bit with the task.</p>
  <p>Our conclusion is that the hybrid systems are likely to be useful for
  control systems, but our interest is using the hybrid systems to
  better fit the expert system: the idea is that the expert system
    contains important stuff, the parameters, if fit, will tell us about the system we're modelling. For example, if we are modelling EEG, the couplings will tell us something important about neural circuits. However, if extra unknown nonlinear terms mean we can't fit the model, we can't use the data to understand the system. Using a hybrid might allow us to fit the data and find the parameters, couplings and the like, that answer the real world questions that we might have. That's what we're going to look at next.</p>

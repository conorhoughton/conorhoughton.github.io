<p>Last week I gave a talk at the European Chapter of Neuropsychopharmacology:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ecnp.eu/meetings/new-frontiers-meeting/">ecnp.eu</a></p>

<p>about my work with Cian and Sydney on Bayesian approaches to cell count data; the slides are here</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15087656">doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15087656</p>

<p>and our paper is here:</p>

<p><a href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/102391">eLife reviewed preprints</a></p>

<p>The main message of the paper is that Bayesian approaches are very
efficient and robust when applied to this class of data; the talk tried
to motivate this with a more general discussion of the scientific
process and the inferential framework we use. It was an interesting
opportunity; the participants were a real mixture, experimentalists,
people who do modelling, people from pharmaceutical companies and from
companies collecting and curating relevant data. My talk was much more
mathematical than most, but the audience were polite and patient and quiet a 
few people afterwards seemed keen to use the methods.</p>

<p>A bonus was the location, the hotel was on the Promenade des
Anglais facing a horizon-wide view of Mediterranean blue, but better
still, given that the work depends on Hamiltonian / Hybrid Monte Carlo
I was able to get a train to Monte Carlo for a photograph of the
casino; you can see me in the mirror.</p>

<p>suggested that the three-state cellular automaton would be a good
test arena for evolution. A three-state cellular automaton is a rule
that makes a pattern in three colors; different rules produce
patterns. Many rules make patterns that go on for ever, many make
patterns that never really get going. The remarkable property is that
there are rules which neither carry on forever, nor stop after only a
  few steps: they continue for multiple steps before stopping. The figure above shows one unusually good rule and the resulting pattern.</p>

<p>The
suggestion from Steve Wolfram is to regard the rules that go on
forever as terrible and to count the length a rule with a finite
patterns as a sort of fitness. The rules are then evolved to become
  fitter and ftter. This is an interesting example of simulated
evolution because it has a complex fitness landscape, as with real
evolution most changes to rules are bad, they make it the fitness
  worse.</p>

<p>I wanted to see if this was a useful place to test the Balwin
Effect and cooperation; to see if groups of agents than can help each
  other by cooperating maintain a useful genetic diversity and evolve to be fitter. The answer, of course, is yes.</p>

<p><img src="../images/2025-04-10_result.png" alt="Two graphs, both with generations running to 5000 on the x-axis and fitness running to 250 on the y-axis, the first, marked breeding reaches a ceiling of just less than 50 after about 2000 generations, the other, marked cooperation is still rising at 5000 and has reached 150" width="400px"></p>

<p>The cooperation scheme is on the right and is still producing improvements after 5000 iterations; the scheme without cooperation is on the left and has stopped getting better and has produced much less fit agents. This might suggest an approach to using the genetic algorithm but I was mostly pleased that it suggests that social behaviours might evolve in an efficient way.</p>

<p>Over the last few years as part of a number of experiments
involving an effort for reward task we have asked a over a thousand
participants <i>Is an event or experience (either positive or
negative) significantly affecting your mood right now?</i>  and if
they said yes, we asked them, if they were willing, to write down what
that event was and to rate how negative or positive the event was
using a slider on a scale of zero to 100.</p>

<p>We ended up with a large collection of events, after cleaning, 363
in all. The most positive were very positive, with one
reporting <i>mindblowing sex</i> and another a marraige proposal; the
most negative are awful. Ultimately one of things we are interested in
is the difference between short and long term mood or affective state
and, in addition to the events and the actual task, we have mood
questionaire date for questionaires aimed at short and long term
mood. To relate the effect to mood we need a numerical quantification
for how negative or positive the events are. Of course, we do have the
participants' own rating, but that may reflect their mood, how do they
interpret the event, rather than the degree to which the event they
mention is actually negative or positive.</p>

<p>To get a score for the events we decided to use an Elo system. We
recruited another set of online participant and asked them to compare
pairs of statements and say which was the more negative, or more
positive; the question varied. Out of these pairwise comparisons we
created a score using the Elo system designed for chess. The graph
below shows how the score changes as comparisons are made; some events
go up, some stay the same, some go down. The initial score is scaled
but is determined by the original rating supplied by the participant
reporting the event and in this graph we use only events that start at the same user determined score. Nonetheless, the comparisons lead to them
diverging.</p>

group of lines that start in the same place at the left but diverge in
what looks like a series of directed random walks as you move right
along the x-axis, which is labelled comparison number; the y-axis is
labelled Elo-Value, three lines are picked out in colour, one goes up,
one stays the same, one goes down" width="400px"></p>

<p>In the way, we now have quantitative scores for the individual events
and we are now examinging the relationship between these scores and the
results of the mood questionaires. This is on-going. However, in the
meantime we were curious as to whether LLMs would perform well on this
task; if they performed the comparisons would they give a similar set
of scores to the humans. This is interesting in two ways, first,
recruiting participants to do the comparisons is slow and expensive,
if LLMs are equally good at the task, this could make it easier to use
Elo rankings to score the emotional valence and salience of text
statements. Second, it is interesting to see how well an LLM can
assess these statements since success would indicate that the LLMs can
  enact a simulation of what might be called emotional intelligence.</p>

<p>Of course, it turns out the LLMs are extremely good at this task,
the graph below plots the result of human rating and rating by
GPT-3.5-Turbo; with the points colored according to the original
score, determined by the self-reported score.</p>

<p><img src="../images/2025-03-21_corr.png" alt="A graph shows dots with a lot of correlation, the x-axis is marked Human Comparison 38, the y-axis GPT Comparison 38; all the dots lie close to the x=y line. They are colored by a heat map, running from about 850 to about 1150, the points at the lower part of the x=y line tend to the 850 color increasing, generally, along the line so that the points close to 1150 tend to be on the upper part of the line." width="400px"></p>

<p>This is impressive and useful! There are more details in the paper
and a link to the data itself, including the 363 statements.</p>

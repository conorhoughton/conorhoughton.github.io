<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> By imposing certain combined inversion
and rotation symmetries on the rational maps for SU(2) BPS monopoles
we construct geodesics in the monopole moduli space. In the moduli
space approximation these geodesics describe a novel kind of monopole
scattering. During these scattering processes axial symmetry is
instantaneously attained and, in some, monopoles with the symmetries
of the regular solids are formed. The simplest example corresponds to
a charge three monopole invariant under a combined inversion and 90
degree rotation symmetry. In this example three well-separated
collinear unit charge monopoles coalesce to form first a tetrahedron,
then a torus, then the dual tetrahedron and finally separate again
along the same axis of motion. We explicitly construct the spectral
curves in this case and use a numerical ADHMN construction to compute
the energy density at various times during the motion. We find that
the dynamics of the zeros of the Higgs field is extremely rich and we
discover a new phenomenon; there exist charge k SU(2) BPS monopoles
with more than k zeros of the Higgs field.

<p><strong>Blurb:</strong>
A geodesic in the space of three-monopoles is identified using a
combining reflection and rotation symmetry and studies using the ADHMN
construction, under the geodesic approximation this corresponds to a
novel type of monopole scattering. In fact, in this scattering the
zeros of the Higgs field shows surprisingly rich dynamics.

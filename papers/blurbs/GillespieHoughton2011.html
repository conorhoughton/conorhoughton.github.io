<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Recently, the SPIKE-distance has been
proposed as a parameter-free and timescale-independent measure of
spike train synchrony. This measure is time resolved since it relies
on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity. However, its
original definition led to spuriously high instantaneous values for
eventlike firing patterns. Here we present a substantial improvement
of this measure that eliminates this shortcoming. The reliability
gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering, i.e.,
time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike
trains. Additional new features include selective and triggered
temporal averaging as well as the instantaneous comparison of spike
train groups. In a second step, a causal SPIKE-distance is defined
such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity rely on past
information only so that time-resolved spike train synchrony can be
estimated in real time. We demonstrate that these methods are capable
of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the
synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic
seizure. Finally, the applicability of both the regular and the
real-time SPIKE-distance to continuous data is illustrated on model
electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.

<p><strong>Blurb:</strong> A new similarity measure for spike trains
is introduced, the measure is particularly simple to apply and so it
has been well used in experimental research.

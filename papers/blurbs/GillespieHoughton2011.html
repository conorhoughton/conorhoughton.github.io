<p><strong>Abstract</strong> A novel method is presented for
calculating the information channel capacity of spike trains. This
method works by fitting a chi-distribution to the distribution of
distances between responses to the same stimulus: the chi-distribution
is the length distribution for a vector of Gaussian variables. The
dimension of this vector defines an effective dimension for the noise
and by rephrasing the problem in terms of distance based quantities,
this allows the channel capacity to be cal culated. As an example, the
capacity is calculated for a data set recorded from auditory neurons
in zebra finch.
</p>
<p><strong>Blurb:</strong> A novel effective noise dimension is
defined for spike train data; this rephases the problem of information
transmission by spike trains into a form that allows channel capacity
to be calculating, giving a straight-forward measure of the
information carry capacity for neuron to neuron signalling.

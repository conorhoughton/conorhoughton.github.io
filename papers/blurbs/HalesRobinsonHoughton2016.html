<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Human decision making is modified by
emotional state. Rodents exhibit similar biases during interpretation
of ambiguous cues that can be altered by affective state
manipulations. In this study, the impact of negative affective state
on judgement bias in rats was measured using an ambiguous-cue
interpretation task. Acute treatment with an anxiogenic drug (FG7142),
and chronic restraint stress and social isolation both induced a bias
towards more negative interpretation of the ambiguous cue. The
diffusion model was fit to behavioural data to allow further analysis
of the underlying decision making processes. To uncover the way in
which parameters vary together in relation to affective state
manipulations, independent component analysis was conducted on rate of
information accumulation and distances to decision threshold
parameters for control data. Results from this analysis were applied
to parameters from negative affective state manipulations. These
projected components were compared to control components to reveal the
changes in decision making processes that are due to affective state
manipulations. Negative affective bias in rodents induced by either
FG7142 or chronic stress is due to a combination of more negative
interpretation of the ambiguous cue, reduced anticipation of the high
reward and increased anticipation of the low reward.

<p><strong>Blurb:</strong> For the first time, the drift diffusion
model is applied to rodent decision making data. By modelling the
decision making during a reward forced choice task we are able to
interpret the consequence of negative affective state manipulations.

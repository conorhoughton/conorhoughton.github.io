<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Spike trains are unreliable. For example,
in the primary sen sory ar- eas, spike patterns and precise spike
times will vary betwee n responses to the same stimulus. Nonetheless,
information about senso ry inputs is communicated in the form of spike
trains. A challenge in un der- standing spike trains is to assess the
significance of indivi dual spikes in encoding information. One
approach is to define a spike tra in met- ric, allowing a distance to
be calculated between pairs of sp ike trains.  In a good metric, this
distance will depend on the informatio n the spike trains encode. This
method has been used previously to calcu- late the timescale over
which the precision of spike times is significant.  Here, a new metric
is constructed based on a simple model of sy naptic conductances which
includes binding site depletion. Inclu ding binding site depletion in
the metric means that a given individual sp ike has a smaller effect
on the distance if it occurs soon after other spikes. The metric
proves effective at classifying neuronal responses b y stimuli in the
sample data set of electro-physiological recordings fr om the pri-
mary auditory area of the zebra finch fore-brain. This shows t hat
this is an effective metric for these spike trains suggesting that in
these spike trains the significance of a spike is modulated by its pr
oximity to previous spikes. This modulation is a putative informati
on-coding property of spike trains

changes in efficiency synapses can undergo in response to pre-synaptic
spiking. Here is demonstrated using a metric-approach that this might,
in some cases, lead to better decoding of the stimulus.</p>

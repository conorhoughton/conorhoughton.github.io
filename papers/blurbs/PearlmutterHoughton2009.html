<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
We propose that the critical function of sleep is to
prevent uncontrolled neuronal feedback while allow-
ing rapid responses and prolonged retention of short-
term memories. Through learning the brain is tuned
to react optimally to environmental challenges. Op-
timal behavior will often require rapid responses and
the prolonged retention of short-term memories. At a
neuronal level, these correspond to recurrent activity
in local networks. Unfortunately, when a network ex-
hibits recurrent activity, small changes in the param-
eters or conditions can lead to runaway oscillations.
Thus, the very changes that improve the processing
performance of the network can put it at risk of run-
away oscillation. To prevent this, stimulus-dependent
network changes should only be permitted when there
is a margin of safety around the current network pa-
rameters. We propose that the essential role of sleep
is to establish this margin by exposing the network
to a variety of inputs, monitoring for erratic behav-
ior, and adjusting the parameters. When sleep is not
possible, an emergency mechanism must come into
play, preventing runaway behavior at the expense of
processing efficiency. This is tiredness.

<p><strong>Blurb:</strong> This paper gives a novel explanation for
why we sleep: it is a proposed that sleep tunes the brain so that its
network behaviour is near critical but not supercritical.

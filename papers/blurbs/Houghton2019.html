<p><strong>Abstract</strong> It is difficult to estimate the mutual
information between spike trains because established methods require
more data than are usually available. Kozachenko-Leonenko estimators
promise to solve this problem but include a smoothing parameter that
must be set. We propose here that the smoothing parameter can be
selected by maximizing the estimated unbiased mutual information. This
is tested on fictive data and shown to work very well.
</p>
<p><strong>Blurb:</strong> This paper introduces a straight forward way
to measure mutual information between spike trains; a problem which
until now required more data that it is typically practical to record.

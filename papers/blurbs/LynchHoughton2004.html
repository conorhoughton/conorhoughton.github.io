<p><strong>Abstract</strong> When the frequencies of the elastic and
pendular oscillations of an elastic pendulum or swinging spring are in
the ratio two-to-one, there is a regular exchange of energy between
the two modes of oscillation. We refer to this phenomenon as
pulsation. Between the horizontal excursions, or pulses, the spring
undergoes a change of azimuth which we call the precession angle. The
pulsation and stepwise precession are the characteristic features of
the dynamics of the swinging spring.  The modulation equations for the
small-amplitude resonant motion of the system are the well-known
three-wave equations. We use Hamiltonian reduction to determine a
complete analytical solution. The amplitudes and phases are expressed
in terms of both Weierstrass and Jacobi elliptic functions. The
strength of the pulsation may be computed from the invariants of the
equations. Several analytical formulas are found for the precession
angle.  We deduce simplified approximate expressions, in terms of
elementary functions, for the pulsation amplitude and precession angle
and demonstrate their high accuracy by numerical experiments. Thus,
for given initial conditions, we can describe the envelope dynamics
without solving the equations. Conversely, given the parameters which
determine the envelope, we can specify initial conditions which, to a
  high level of accuracy, yield this envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Blurb:</strong>  The swinging spring is a spring with a weighted end: a bouncy
pendulum. For a particular ratio of the weight and the
spring-strength the swinging spring has an odd dynamics where it
switches between a swinging and a bobbing behaviour. This switching
  behaviour is described in this paper.</p>

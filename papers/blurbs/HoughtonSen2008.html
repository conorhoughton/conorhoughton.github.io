<p><strong>Abstract</strong>The Victor-Purpura spike-train metric has
recently been extended to a family of multi-neuron metrics and used to
analyze spike trains recorded simultaneously from pairs of proximate
neurons. The Victor-Purpura metric is one of the two metrics commonly
used for quantify- ing the distance between two spike trains, the
other is the van Rossum metric. Here, we suggest an extension of the
van Rossum metric to a multi-neuron metric. We believe this gives a
metric which is both natural and easy to calculate. Both types of
multi-neuron metric are applied to simulated data and are
compared.</p>
<p><strong>Blurb:</strong> A spike train metric measures a distance between spike trains that is
smaller for responses to similar stimuli than  for responses to very
different stimuli. This paper introduces a spike train metric for
multi-unit data; this metric is inexpensive to calculate allowing
metric-based approaches to be applied to multi-unit recordings.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong> We discuss the similarities between BPS
monopoles and Skyrmions, and point to an underlying connection in
terms of rational maps between Riemann spheres. This involves the
introduction of a new ansatz for Skyrme fields. We use this to
construct good approximations to several known Skyrmions, including
all the minimal energy configurations up to baryon number nine, and
some new solutions such as a baryon number seventeen Skyrme field with
the truncated icosahedron structure of a buckyball.  The new approach
is also used to understand the low-lying vibrational modes of
Skyrmions, which are required for quantization. Along the way we
discover an interesting Morse function on the space of rational maps
which may be of use in understanding the Sen forms on the monopole
moduli spaces.

The Skyrme model is an effective model of nucleons: it is a pi-mesons
theory in which nuclei arise as soliton solutions. In this paper we
show how to find these solutions approximately using an ansatz that
seperates the angular and radial behaviour.

Purkinje cells produce two types of action potential; simple spikes
and complex spikes. Other cells have two types of spiking activity,
CA3 pyramidal neurons have a bursting behaviour for example. Complex
spikes are different though, there is an initial spike and then lots
of smaller spikelets. It would be great to know why the Purkinje cell
does this, a useful step might seem working out how it does it. There
are huge, complicated and very impressive models of Purkinje cells,
they are an amazing achievement, capturing the detailed behaviour of
the cell.  However, because they are so complicated, the don't isolate
the mechanism behind the complex spiking. That's what we try to do in
our paper, we try to find as simple a model as possible that has
complex spiking.  Neuronal electrodynamics seems designed to produce
stereotypical spikes, so finding a mechanism for spikelets, smaller
and more variable in amplitude than a typical action potential is
hard.  However, Purkinje cells have a "resurgent channel", a different
sort of sodium channel that has an addition inactive state.  What we
show in our paper is that this resurgent channel can give
complex-spike-like behaviour.
